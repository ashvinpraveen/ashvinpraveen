	<p>
		Hey there! I'm Ashvin, a builder at heart who's passionate about the intersection of technology, 
		design, and human experiences. I love bringing ideas to life - whether that's through code, 
		products, or just good old-fashioned storytelling.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://cleve.ai">Cleve</a>, where we're reimagining how 
		businesses interact with their data. Before this, I've had the privilege of working with amazing 
		teams and building things that people actually use and love.
	</p>

	<h2>What drives me</h2>
	<p>
		I believe the best products come from deeply understanding people and their needs. I'm fascinated 
		by the process of turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. There's something magical 
		about that moment when everything clicks together.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm drawn to the messy, non-linear process of building things. The late-night debugging sessions, 
		the "aha!" moments, the countless iterations - it's all part of the beautiful chaos of creation.
	</p>

	<h2>Beyond work</h2>
	<p>
		When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me exploring new ideas, reading about everything 
		from philosophy to the latest tech trends, or just enjoying good conversations with interesting people.
	</p>

	<p>
		I love the colors green and those messy, beautiful gradients - they remind me that the best 
		things in life aren't always perfectly defined. Sometimes the magic happens in the spaces between.
	</p>

	<p>
		Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about ideas, collaborate on something interesting, 
		or just say hello. I'm always up for a good conversation.
	</p>
